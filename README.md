# PDF and Word Resume to LaTeX Converter

This project aims to develop a tool that converts PDF and Word document files into LaTeX format. The primary focus, in the short term, is to enable the conversion of resumes, with a long-term vision of expanding the functionality to handle a wide range of documents, including math proofs, homework assignments, papers, and even pictures.
